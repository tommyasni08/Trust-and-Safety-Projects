# Trust & Safety for User-Generated Content (UGC)

(Moderation, Harm Detection & Platform Integrity)

## 0 TL;DR

T&S for UGC focuses on keeping user-to-user ecosystems **safe, authentic, and compliant**.
Instead of detecting stolen money or promo abuse, we detect **harmful or policy-violating content** — misinformation, hate, grooming, nudity, violence, scams, and coordinated inauthentic behavior.
Detection combines **machine-learning pipelines, policy taxonomies, and human moderation workflows under strict governance, fairness, and transparency requirements.**

## 1. Definition & Scope

- **Trust & Safety**: Function ensuring a platform remains safe, lawful, and inclusive.
- **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Any post, comment, video, or livestream uploaded by users.
- **Core Goals**:
  1. Prevent real-world harm.
  2. Maintain community trust.
  3. Ensure legal compliance (GDPR, DSA, COPPA, etc.).

## 2. Key Content Risk Domains

| Category                            | Example on TikTok                   | Detection Angle                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Adult & Sexual Content**          | Nudity, sexual acts                 | CV/NLP classification, hash matching |
| **Violence & Graphic Content**      | Fights, gore                        | Image & audio models                 |
| **Hate Speech / Harassment**        | Slurs, targeted abuse               | Text & contextual NLP                |
| **Misinformation / Disinformation** | Health or election misinfo          | Claim matching, fact-checking        |
| **Child Safety / CSAM**             | Grooming content                    | Hash databases, metadata             |
| **Scams & Deceptive Content**       | Giveaway frauds, impersonation      | Link analysis, entity matching       |
| **Spam & Inauthentic Engagement**   | Bot comments, follow farms          | Graph analysis                       |
| **Platform Integrity**              | Coordinated manipulation, brigading | Behavior & network signals           |

## 3. Industry Example — TikTok Moderation Ecosystem

- Multi-Layered Pipeline:
  1. **Pre-upload screening** (hash matching via PhotoDNA, HIVE).
  2. **Real-time content classification** (CV/NLP models).
  3. **Post-upload risk scoring & sampling** for human review.
  4. **Feedback loop** feeding model training.
- **Regional operations centers**: Singapore, Dublin, Los Angeles.
- **Policy team + ML team + Ops team** work in triad:
  - Policy defines rules.
  - ML builds detectors.
  - Ops enforces at scale.

## 4. Business Importance

| Dimension           | Impact                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Regulatory**      | Non-compliance → DSA fines (€ M range)     |
| **Brand Trust**     | Unsafe feeds → user churn, advertiser loss |
| **Revenue**         | Advertisers require brand-safe inventory   |
| **Platform Health** | T&S score correlates with retention & LTV  |

## 5. Signals & Data to Capture

**Content-level**: text, image, audio, metadata (hashtag, caption, language, objects).
**User-level**: age, account tenure, device, IP, history of violations.
**Behavioral**: posting velocity, hashtag entropy, network reactions.
**Graph signals**: retweet/share trees, cross-comment density, suspicious community bridging.
**Appeals & Feedback**: overturn rate, review latency.

## 6. Feature Engineering Examples

| Category | Example Feature                                     | Insight                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Text NLP | Toxicity score from Transformer model               | Harassment probability |
| Vision   | Nudity/weapon probability from CV model             | Physical harm          |
| Audio    | Profanity ratio / sound embedding                   | Policy breach          |
| Behavior | posts_per_hour, burstiness index                    | Bot or brigade         |
| Network  | clustering coefficient, edge density in topic graph | Coordinated campaign   |

## 7. Modeling Approaches

- **Multimodal ML**: Text + Vision + Audio fusion.
- **Ensemble Risk Scoring**: Combine models with policy weights.
- Active Learning: Human feedback improves model coverage.
- **Contextual Moderation**: Model evaluates content + context (user relationship, reply chain).
- **Graph Models**: Detect coordinated inauthentic behavior.

## 8. Human Moderation Pipeline

| Step                        | Description                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Queue Prioritization** | High-risk content (violence, CSAM) → priority queues |
| **2. Review Tooling**       | Moderators see context, policy snippet               |
| **3. Decision Tagging**     | Policy violation category + severity                 |
| **4. Appeal & Audit**       | Second-level QA + user appeals                       |
| **5. Feedback to ML**       | Tag → retraining data                                |

Moderators are the “labeling engine” for T&S ML systems.

## 9. Labeling & Metrics

- **Precision & Recall @ Policy**: measure accuracy per violation type.
- **Appeal Reversal Rate**: gauge fairness.
- **Time-to-Moderation**: speed of action.
- **Coverage**: % of UGC auto-reviewed vs manual.
- **User Satisfaction / Trust Index**: survey feedback post-decision.

## 10. Governance & Ethics

- **Transparency Reports**: publish removal stats & rationale.
- **Fairness & Bias Control**: avoid systemic cultural biases.
- **Explainability Tools**: show moderation reason to user.
- **Policy Lifecycle**: research → draft → review → train → enforce.
- **Moderator Well-being**: exposure management and rotation.

## 11. Dashboard & Analytics

- Violation rate by policy category.
- Appeal rate and overturn % by region.
- User trust score over time (post vs violation density).

## 12. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall                                    | Remedy                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Over-aggressive models → over-blocking art | Context-aware NLP + appeal pipeline       |
| Fragmented policy updates                  | Centralized taxonomy management           |
| Latency between model & ops feedback       | Real-time label sync loop                 |
| Ignoring regional context                  | Geo-specific thresholds & policy variants |
| Moderator burnout                          | Duty-cycle rotation & psych support       |

## 13. Key Takeaways

- T&S for UGC extends fraud analytics into human behavior and content semantics.
- Detection = combination of ML, policy, and human judgment.
- Success metrics include fairness, trust, and transparency, not just catch rate.
- Platforms like TikTok achieve scale through multimodal ML + human ops integration.
- “Fraud protection keeps money safe; T&S keeps communities safe.”
